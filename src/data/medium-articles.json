Let\u2019s dive into the details and see what made a lasting impression on us\u200a\u2014\u200apositive or negative.</p>\n<h3>Stencil</h3>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*cHHhdKdOZxo4Wf16\"><figcaption><em>\u201cStencil doesn\u2019t fight the web platform.

These are supported by all modern browser (meaning not IE11) and do not require any additionally loaded libraries to be executed\u200a\u2014\u200aa big performance win.</p>\n<h4>Shadow DOM</h4>\n<p>The components use the shadow DOM, which means that we don\u2019t have to worry about the CSS selectors\u2019 scope. If the browser does not support a shadow DOM, the CSS styles are added directly to the element as an attribute.</p>\n<h4>JSX Support</h4>\n<p>Stencil relies on the template syntax JSX known from React. This saves training time\u200a\u2014\u200athe declarative or \u201creactive\u201d way of thinking is directly transferable: If the underlying data changes, the framework takes care of adapting the\u00a0display.</p>\n<pre><a href=\"http://twitter.com/Component\">@Component</a>({<br>  tag: 'mvp-day',<br>})<br>export class Day {<br><a href=\"http://twitter.com/Prop\">@Prop</a>() day: DailyPlan;</pre>\n<pre>render() {<br>    return (<br>      &lt;div&gt;<br>        &lt;div&gt;{this.day.name}&lt;/div&gt;<br>        &lt;ul&gt;<br>          {this.day.recipes.map((_, time) =&gt; (<br>            &lt;mvp-tile day={this.dayIndex} time={time} /&gt;<br>          ))}<br>        &lt;/ul&gt;<br>      &lt;/div&gt;<br>    );<br>  }<br>}</pre>\n<h4>Functional Components</h4>\n<p>We are not convinced by the implementation of functional components. React\u2019s functional components, in combination with hooks, cover the same range of functionality as class components. Stencil does provide functional components, but with a different concept and some disadvantages compared to\u00a0React:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>They are not compiled to Web Components</li>\n<li>They do not have a shadow DOM and scoped\u00a0CSS</li>\n<li>They cannot have a\u00a0state</li>\n</ul>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*wGZ0ar2xyH2ZR9Dd\"><figcaption>Team Stencil\u2019s Most Valuable\u00a0Planner</figcaption></figure><h3>Svelte</h3>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/988/0*sUoQJ1cWYT51hIGs\"><figcaption><em>\u201cCybernetically enhanced web\u00a0apps.\u201d</em></figcaption></figure><h4>Boilerplate free</h4>\n<p>Svelte\u2019s promise is to free you from writing unnecessary code. The components consist of a script tag and the markup. So keeping Svelte components tidy and decoupled is\u00a0easy:</p>\n<pre>&lt;script lang=\"ts\"&gt;<br>  import Button from '../elements/button.svelte';<br>  export let texts: string[] = [];<br>  export let onClick: () =&gt; void;<br>&lt;/script&gt;</pre>\n<pre>&lt;div&gt;<br>  &lt;ul&gt;<br>    {#each texts as text}<br>      &lt;li&gt;{text}&lt;/li&gt;<br>    {/each}<br>  &lt;/ul&gt;<br>  &lt;div&gt;<br>    &lt;Button {onClick}&gt;+&lt;/Button&gt;<br>  &lt;/div&gt;<br>&lt;/div&gt;</pre>\n<h4>Reactive</h4>\n<p>Like React and Stencil, Svelte relies on a reactive approach. The DOM is automatically updated as soon as the state of a component changes. Additionally, reactive blocks or declarations can be defined, and they are automatically executed as soon as a value of the existing variables changes. We found it unintuitive that Svelte does not notice when an element is added to an array. But this can be solved with the following <a href=\"https://svelte.dev/tutorial/updating-arrays-and-objects\">workaround</a>:</p>\n<pre>mappedDays = [...mappedDays];</pre>\n<h4>Compile at\u00a0Build</h4>\n<p>While React uses a virtual DOM, Svelte compiles the components separately during the build process. Thus, the main computational load is shifted to the build process. This lightens the browser\u2019s load because the components already exist in the format they will be added to the DOM. Besides, changes are made directly to the DOM at\u00a0runtime.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*mOoITv-0a21bw2tZ\"><figcaption>Team Svelte\u2019s Meal\u00a0Planner</figcaption></figure><h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>First things first: Hack days are the perfect setup to test new technologies in a short time.

Not having to commute to work every day also has its benefits as it turns\u00a0out.</p>\n<p>Instead of concentrating on all the things that were suddenly impossible, I leaned into the stillness that the pandemic imposed on us. It allowed me to immerse myself in subjects like meditation, stress and emotional regulation.</p>\n<blockquote>\u201cStillness is the foundation of understanding and insight.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\u2014 Thich Nhat\u00a0Hanh</blockquote>\n<p>As Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh wisely points out, it is in stillness that we discover the most profound insights. At first I hoped that a better understanding of our response to stress would be helpful in dealing with all the additional stressors of the pandemic. What I didn\u2019t anticipate was how the insights I gained changed how I interacted with myself, others, and the world around us. But first, let\u2019s take a step back\u200a\u2014\u200away back into the Stone Age, actually.</p>\n<h3>Relic from a bygone\u00a0era</h3>\n<p>Back when our earliest ancestors walked the Earth, our stress response started to evolve. Simply put, stress is a suddenly arising, challenging or threatening situation that compels us to react. All the things and situations that trigger a stress response are called stressors.</p>\n<p>Back then a common stressor would have been a hungry sabretooth tiger. It was an essential survival mechanism to respond as quickly as possible to such a threat, so we developed a fight-or-flight response. In a split second, a lot of energy would be made available by an increased heart rate, high blood pressure and muscle tension. Our bodies would make good use of all that energy by either fighting back or running\u00a0away.</p>\n<p>Now, from an evolutionary point of view, 300'000 years are only a wink. Although stressors nowadays look very different than they did in the Stone Age, our stress response has stayed the same. This means that our physiological response to a sabretooth tiger is basically the same as to an angry boss. Even though both are menacing opponents, one is not quite as\u00a0deadly.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*VetWEnavH59F6bf8bhVO7A.png\"><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@maxvdo?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Max van den Oetelaar</a> on\u00a0<a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>Additionally, even a stressor that only exists in our imagination triggers a stress response. This results in a world where chronic stress and conditions like high blood-pressure, sleep disorders, anxiety, exhaustion and burnout are at an all-time high. So, what\u2019s the solution?</p>\n<p>In their book about mindfulness-based stress reduction MBSR, Tobias and Sonja Maren Esch suggest that in order to reduce stress we first need to become aware of potential stressors in our lives. Then we can start cultivating a mindful attitude and adopt different management strategies.</p>\n<h3>The last of the human\u00a0freedoms</h3>\n<p>Stress can be roughly grouped into choice-based stress and unavoidable stress. Choice-based stress would be something like accepting yet another work assignment. The illness of a close family member\u200a\u2014\u200aor a global pandemic for that matter\u200a\u2014\u200awould be examples of unavoidable stress.</p>\n<p>When we think of potential stressors we realize that most of them fall into the first category. Managing choice-based stress requires us to question our personal values and the values of our society. Do I work overtime in order to accomplish an important personal goal or do I feel compelled by the high performance standards of my company? What could I change in order to gain more down\u00a0time?</p>\n<p>In the realm of unavoidable stress, an important factor is how we perceive it. In his bestselling book \u201cFull Catastrophe Living\u201d Jon Kabat-Zinn puts it like\u00a0this:</p>\n<blockquote>It can be particularly helpful to keep in mind from moment to moment that it is not so much the stressors in our lives but how we see them and what we do with them that determines how much we are at their mercy. If we change the way we see, we can change the way we\u00a0respond.</blockquote>\n<p>Seeing stress as a natural, physiological mechanism that once fulfilled an important evolutionary function was a real game-changer for me. I realized that I could deliberately decide how to react to everyday stressors instead of being swept away by my automatic response to them. The truth is that we all have the freedom to choose our own attitude. Or in the words of Holocaust survivor Viktor\u00a0Frankl:</p>\n<blockquote>\u201cEverything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms\u200a\u2014\u200ato choose one\u2019s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one\u2019s own\u00a0way.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\u2014 Viktor\u00a0Frankl</blockquote>\n<h3>An unexpected ally</h3>\n<p>But how does a change of attitude help us to better cope with stress? This is where mediation comes in. The mindfulness and awareness we cultivate during meditation helps us notice the signs of stress early on. We learn how to differentiate between the external circumstances and our internal bodily reaction to\u00a0them.</p>\n<p>Spending time in the stillness of meditation may seem like a lonely endeavor. It\u2019s quite startling to discover that that\u2019s not the case. For when you take the time to sit down and focus inward, you soon realize that there\u2019s an uninvited guest that cannot help but comment and nag about everything you do.

Not having to commute to work every day also has its benefits as it turns\u00a0out.</p>\n<p>Instead of concentrating on all the things that were suddenly impossible, I leaned into the stillness that the pandemic imposed on us. It allowed me to immerse myself in subjects like meditation, stress and emotional regulation.</p>\n<blockquote>\u201cStillness is the foundation of understanding and insight.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\u2014 Thich Nhat\u00a0Hanh</blockquote>\n<p>As Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh wisely points out, it is in stillness that we discover the most profound insights. At first I hoped that a better understanding of our response to stress would be helpful in dealing with all the additional stressors of the pandemic. What I didn\u2019t anticipate was how the insights I gained changed how I interacted with myself, others, and the world around us. But first, let\u2019s take a step back\u200a\u2014\u200away back into the Stone Age, actually.</p>\n<h3>Relic from a bygone\u00a0era</h3>\n<p>Back when our earliest ancestors walked the Earth, our stress response started to evolve. Simply put, stress is a suddenly arising, challenging or threatening situation that compels us to react. All the things and situations that trigger a stress response are called stressors.</p>\n<p>Back then a common stressor would have been a hungry sabretooth tiger. It was an essential survival mechanism to respond as quickly as possible to such a threat, so we developed a fight-or-flight response. In a split second, a lot of energy would be made available by an increased heart rate, high blood pressure and muscle tension. Our bodies would make good use of all that energy by either fighting back or running\u00a0away.</p>\n<p>Now, from an evolutionary point of view, 300'000 years are only a wink. Although stressors nowadays look very different than they did in the Stone Age, our stress response has stayed the same. This means that our physiological response to a sabretooth tiger is basically the same as to an angry boss. Even though both are menacing opponents, one is not quite as\u00a0deadly.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*VetWEnavH59F6bf8bhVO7A.png\"><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@maxvdo?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Max van den Oetelaar</a> on\u00a0<a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>Additionally, even a stressor that only exists in our imagination triggers a stress response. This results in a world where chronic stress and conditions like high blood-pressure, sleep disorders, anxiety, exhaustion and burnout are at an all-time high. So, what\u2019s the solution?</p>\n<p>In their book about mindfulness-based stress reduction MBSR, Tobias and Sonja Maren Esch suggest that in order to reduce stress we first need to become aware of potential stressors in our lives. Then we can start cultivating a mindful attitude and adopt different management strategies.</p>\n<h3>The last of the human\u00a0freedoms</h3>\n<p>Stress can be roughly grouped into choice-based stress and unavoidable stress. Choice-based stress would be something like accepting yet another work assignment. The illness of a close family member\u200a\u2014\u200aor a global pandemic for that matter\u200a\u2014\u200awould be examples of unavoidable stress.</p>\n<p>When we think of potential stressors we realize that most of them fall into the first category. Managing choice-based stress requires us to question our personal values and the values of our society. Do I work overtime in order to accomplish an important personal goal or do I feel compelled by the high performance standards of my company? What could I change in order to gain more down\u00a0time?</p>\n<p>In the realm of unavoidable stress, an important factor is how we perceive it. In his bestselling book \u201cFull Catastrophe Living\u201d Jon Kabat-Zinn puts it like\u00a0this:</p>\n<blockquote>It can be particularly helpful to keep in mind from moment to moment that it is not so much the stressors in our lives but how we see them and what we do with them that determines how much we are at their mercy. If we change the way we see, we can change the way we\u00a0respond.</blockquote>\n<p>Seeing stress as a natural, physiological mechanism that once fulfilled an important evolutionary function was a real game-changer for me. I realized that I could deliberately decide how to react to everyday stressors instead of being swept away by my automatic response to them. The truth is that we all have the freedom to choose our own attitude. Or in the words of Holocaust survivor Viktor\u00a0Frankl:</p>\n<blockquote>\u201cEverything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms\u200a\u2014\u200ato choose one\u2019s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one\u2019s own\u00a0way.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\u2014 Viktor\u00a0Frankl</blockquote>\n<h3>An unexpected ally</h3>\n<p>But how does a change of attitude help us to better cope with stress? This is where mediation comes in. The mindfulness and awareness we cultivate during meditation helps us notice the signs of stress early on. We learn how to differentiate between the external circumstances and our internal bodily reaction to\u00a0them.</p>\n<p>Spending time in the stillness of meditation may seem like a lonely endeavor. It\u2019s quite startling to discover that that\u2019s not the case. For when you take the time to sit down and focus inward, you soon realize that there\u2019s an uninvited guest that cannot help but comment and nag about everything you do.

The micro frontend components are built as React components written in <a href=\"https://www.typescriptlang.org/\">TypeScript</a>, documented in <a href=\"https://storybook.js.org/\">Storybook</a> and altogether stored in a Monorepo.</p>\n<p>If you want to read more about the benefits of separating your components into micro components, check out our previous blog\u00a0post:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.smartive.ch/sharing-modularized-frontend-components-72f9fe4d9514\">Micro Frontends \u2014 Sharing Modularized Frontend Components</a></p>\n<p>A monorepo (mono repository) is an old concept where one source code repository stores all your code and assets of multiple projects\u200a\u2014\u200anot to be confused with a monolithic application.</p>\n<h3>Benefits of a\u00a0Monorepo</h3>\n<p>We still use self-contained and clearly separated micro components hosted in the same repository, but take advantage of the increased visibility of components within a monorepo:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Reusability</strong>\u200a\u2014\u200aInside the monorepo existing components are easy to discover, integrate and\u00a0test.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Refactoring</strong>\u200a\u2014\u200aIt is much easier to introduce repository wide refactorings, new features (e.g. switch to a new single sign on) and breaking changes. Without a monorepo, adopting new major releases with breaking changes of individual component libraries takes months, whereas the monorepo allows us to anticipate a large part of the\u00a0changes.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Dependency Management</strong>\u200a\u2014\u200aMuch simpler dependency management through visibility.

Under the hood they share the same user login context and messaging API to talk to each\u00a0other.</p>\n<p>A new theme for all components can be added in the blink of an eye. We\u2019re providing a utility library to abstract complicated concepts and provide simple, reusable hooks. This means, getting the user context is as easy as calling a <em>useUser()</em> hook.</p>\n<p>Within one year we counted a total of 1 442 micro frontend component releases from 35 different authors on our\u00a0setup.</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s dive in and take a look at our setup and the challenges we were facing. The micro frontend components are built as React components written in <a href=\"https://www.typescriptlang.org/\">TypeScript</a>, documented in <a href=\"https://storybook.js.org/\">Storybook</a> and altogether stored in a Monorepo.</p>\n<p>If you want to read more about the benefits of separating your components into micro components, check out our previous blog\u00a0post:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.smartive.ch/sharing-modularized-frontend-components-72f9fe4d9514\">Micro Frontends \u2014 Sharing Modularized Frontend Components</a></p>\n<p>A monorepo (mono repository) is an old concept where one source code repository stores all your code and assets of multiple projects\u200a\u2014\u200anot to be confused with a monolithic application.</p>\n<h3>Benefits of a\u00a0Monorepo</h3>\n<p>We still use self-contained and clearly separated micro components hosted in the same repository, but take advantage of the increased visibility of components within a monorepo:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Reusability</strong>\u200a\u2014\u200aInside the monorepo existing components are easy to discover, integrate and\u00a0test.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Refactoring</strong>\u200a\u2014\u200aIt is much easier to introduce repository wide refactorings, new features (e.g. switch to a new single sign on) and breaking changes. Without a monorepo, adopting new major releases with breaking changes of individual component libraries takes months, whereas the monorepo allows us to anticipate a large part of the\u00a0changes.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Dependency Management</strong>\u200a\u2014\u200aMuch simpler dependency management through visibility. If you make a change you can see immediately what else will be impacted.

    "description": "\n<h4><a href=\"https://blog.smartive.ch/graphql/home\">Advanced GraphQL\u00a0APIs</a></h4>\n<h3>GraphQL and Elasticsearch: A Love Letter\u00a0\ud83d\udc8c</h3>\n<h4>Learnings from using Elasticsearch as a GraphQL Backend and how to make the most out of\u00a0it.</h4>\n<p>There are several libraries which expose the full Elasticsearch API as a GraphQL API. But like traditional REST APIs with Elasticsearch Backends, we mostly don\u2019t want to expose all the possibilities which the Elasticsearch Query Language offers to the end\u00a0users.</p>\n<p>Let me guide you through how we built a GraphQL API on Elasticsearch while leveraging the advantages of\u00a0both.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*JfGxzMFr-hGWjyZ4q2CqRg.png\"><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@girlwithredhat?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Girl with red hat</a> on\u00a0<a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><h3>GraphQL and Elasticsearch in the\u00a0Field</h3>\n<p>Our GraphQL API on Elasticsearch powers one of the largest websites dedicated to cooking in Switzerland, with thousands of recipes. It delivers relevant search results and personalized teasers in the blink of an eye by leveraging both, the benefits of GraphQL as an aggregated API endpoint and Elasticsearch as a performant full-text search and recommendation engine.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*IqOcrhxg_p7UjqL3o3qKRg.png\"><figcaption>Our GraphQL API powers <a href=\"https://migusto.migros.ch/\">https://migusto.migros.ch</a> as a fast, customizable and user-centered recipe search\u00a0engine.</figcaption></figure><p>A more detailed description of our GraphQL Elasticsearch API in German language can be found on our company page as a one\u00a0pager:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bosw.smartive.cloud/migusto\">Migros Rezepte: eine schnelle Rezeptsuche f\u00fcr alle.</a></p>\n<h3>System Architecture</h3>\n<p>This is our setup: We have several web frontends which need different data from our <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/\">Elasticsearch</a> backend and some other 3rd party REST APIs. We will look at an API for recipes which is used to display recipe teasers as search results and the recipe detail\u00a0page.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*lb6RJT0T_wa8gw0yjnOQoA.png\"><figcaption>GraphQL API with Elasticsearch System\u00a0Overview</figcaption></figure><p>We will focus on our primary goal, which is to provide our web frontends with an easily accessible GraphQL API endpoint for data from Elasticsearch.</p>\n<h3>Elasticsearch and\u00a0GraphQL</h3>\n<p>We could have used one of the existing GraphQL to Elasticsearch libraries\u200a\u2014\u200abut that would not have served our main goal of a simple end-user friendly API,\u00a0because:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>we don\u2019t want to expose all possible Elasticsearch methods with its complex query\u00a0language</li>\n<li>we want to determine granularly which documents and fields should be available via the API and hide irrelevant fields(e.g. metadata used for\u00a0scoring)</li>\n<li>we only want to expose what\u2019s needed by the end users\u200a\u2014\u200aand keep as much flexibility as possible for further changes and enhancements without breaking the\u00a0API</li>\n<li>we want the ability to include 3rd party resources and APIs in a simple\u00a0way</li>\n<li>we want to make the GraphQL API for the end user as simple as possible and hide complex Elasticsearch queries (e.g. the ones needed for full-text search, boosting and personalization) under the\u00a0hood</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Therefore, we decided to build our GraphQL API granularly, based on the needs of our API customers. By explicitly defining the GraphQL API and its schema we are keeping the flexibility to extend and\u00a0enhance.</p>\n<h3>Reusing GraphQL, Typescript and Elasticsearch Schema</h3>\n<p>One key benefit of GraphQL is the well defined schema which makes it easy to consume the API. But this schema must be explicitly defined.</p>\n<p>From the data import into Elasticsearch up to the GraphQL endpoint, the data schema is mostly redundant. To minimize error prone copy pasting and code duplication, we used <a href=\"https://www.prisma.io/blog/the-problems-of-schema-first-graphql-development-x1mn4cb0tyl3\">the Code First approach</a> and share the schema. Write once\u200a\u2014\u200ause everywhere.</p>\n<p>Therefore we defined our data schema by using Typescript models. These declarative models are then converted to Elasticsearch and GraphQL schema as needed. We open sourced part of this approach as <a href=\"https://github.com/smartive/es-model\">@smartive/es-model</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@smartive/es-model\">@smartive/es-model</a></p>\n<h3>Uncover Performance Issues with Loadtests</h3>\n<p>For meaningful results, we gathered the most frequent queries of our frontends and tested them against the GraphQL API at scale. We used <a href=\"https://jmeter.apache.org/\">jMeter</a> to set up the load tests and <a href=\"https://www.flood.io/\">flood.io</a> to parallelize the load onto different machines.</p>\n<p>This uncovered performance issues and bottlenecks. That is why we implemented caching for expensive 3rd party requests. We also identified issues with our relational dataset and the way GraphQL works. By denormalizing our datasource we could resolve this issue and even improve the overall performance.</p>\n<blockquote>At the end we have a GraphQL API running on two NodeJS nodes and two Elasticsearch nodes, <strong>serving up to 5000rpm in \u00f8\u00a050ms</strong>.</blockquote>\n<h3>Denormalizing Datasource for Improved Performance</h3>\n<p>Since we have much more reads than writes to our datasource we could drastically increase the performance by denormalizing our relational datasource in Elasticsearch.</p>\n<p>Imagine you want to retrieve the top 10 recipes with their ingredients which match your search term \u201cpie\u201d from the GraphQL\u00a0API.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/461/1*hl5EbYmyxHHCXdPdHz6Xqw.png\"></figure><p>If the ingredient details like name and image are stored in a separate index/table, then\u200a\u2014\u200aper default\u200a\u2014\u200athe GraphQL API will make one additional Elasticsearch Query for every ingredient of every recipe in the result\u00a0set.</p>\n<p>So for one GraphQL API call you would\u00a0have:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1 Elasticsearch query which retrieves 10\u00a0recipes</li>\n<li>5 Elasticsearch queries per recipe to retrieve the recipe\u2019s ingredient details (if a recipe has \u00f8 5 ingredients)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This makes a total of <strong>51 Elasticsearch queries per GraphQL\u00a0query</strong>!</p>\n<p>We could optimize this <a href=\"https://blog.smartive.ch/advanced-graphql-patterns-embrace-the-ast-4929647c5bd3\">by parsing the AST context of the GraphQL Query</a> to bring it down to one Elasticsearch query for all ingredients of the 10 recipes. But this is still too much. If we want to retrieve our result set with one single Elasticsearch query per GraphQL query we need to denormalize our datasource.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*f6lCaeOG99suka21ZUpCzw.png\"><figcaption>Datamodel of a Recipe with Ingredients: Normalized and denormalized</figcaption></figure><p>By denormalizing, we include the ingredients detail in every recipe dataset. This way the GraphQL API only needs one single Elasticsearch Query to get all the requested data.</p>\n<p>This approach of course only makes sense if you have a high read/write ratio and your datasource changes infrequently. But if that\u2019s the case, then denormalization can drastically improve performance.</p>\n<h3>Caching Expensive Requests with\u00a0Redis</h3>\n<p>Caching GraphQL APIs is much more complex than caching REST endpoints. So to keep things simple, we only applied caching for resources which are not under our control as for example 3rd party\u00a0APIs.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*tTkojwYiLDLr-F1srfF2QA.png\"><figcaption>Redis as an intermediate Cache for expensive Requests</figcaption></figure><p>For expensive 3rd Party REST API calls which are not under our control, we\u2019ve chosen to cache data in <a href=\"https://redis.io/\">Redis</a>. The cache is invalidated when data is updated or\u00a0stale.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>GraphQL provides a great framework for organizing and combining your APIs. But it also introduces a lot of complexity when dealing with relational data. Elasticsearch offers professional full-text search and high performance data retrieval. Together they build a world class team. But be aware of your use cases and restrict the APIs to make sure to deliver the best performance.</p>\n<h3>Build Enterprise-Grade GraphQL Applications</h3>\n<p>Want to become a GraphQL pro?

But like traditional REST APIs with Elasticsearch Backends, we mostly don\u2019t want to expose all the possibilities which the Elasticsearch Query Language offers to the end\u00a0users.</p>\n<p>Let me guide you through how we built a GraphQL API on Elasticsearch while leveraging the advantages of\u00a0both.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*JfGxzMFr-hGWjyZ4q2CqRg.png\"><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@girlwithredhat?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Girl with red hat</a> on\u00a0<a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><h3>GraphQL and Elasticsearch in the\u00a0Field</h3>\n<p>Our GraphQL API on Elasticsearch powers one of the largest websites dedicated to cooking in Switzerland, with thousands of recipes. It delivers relevant search results and personalized teasers in the blink of an eye by leveraging both, the benefits of GraphQL as an aggregated API endpoint and Elasticsearch as a performant full-text search and recommendation engine.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*IqOcrhxg_p7UjqL3o3qKRg.png\"><figcaption>Our GraphQL API powers <a href=\"https://migusto.migros.ch/\">https://migusto.migros.ch</a> as a fast, customizable and user-centered recipe search\u00a0engine.</figcaption></figure><p>A more detailed description of our GraphQL Elasticsearch API in German language can be found on our company page as a one\u00a0pager:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bosw.smartive.cloud/migusto\">Migros Rezepte: eine schnelle Rezeptsuche f\u00fcr alle.</a></p>\n<h3>System Architecture</h3>\n<p>This is our setup: We have several web frontends which need different data from our <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/\">Elasticsearch</a> backend and some other 3rd party REST APIs. We will look at an API for recipes which is used to display recipe teasers as search results and the recipe detail\u00a0page.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*lb6RJT0T_wa8gw0yjnOQoA.png\"><figcaption>GraphQL API with Elasticsearch System\u00a0Overview</figcaption></figure><p>We will focus on our primary goal, which is to provide our web frontends with an easily accessible GraphQL API endpoint for data from Elasticsearch.</p>\n<h3>Elasticsearch and\u00a0GraphQL</h3>\n<p>We could have used one of the existing GraphQL to Elasticsearch libraries\u200a\u2014\u200abut that would not have served our main goal of a simple end-user friendly API,\u00a0because:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>we don\u2019t want to expose all possible Elasticsearch methods with its complex query\u00a0language</li>\n<li>we want to determine granularly which documents and fields should be available via the API and hide irrelevant fields(e.g. metadata used for\u00a0scoring)</li>\n<li>we only want to expose what\u2019s needed by the end users\u200a\u2014\u200aand keep as much flexibility as possible for further changes and enhancements without breaking the\u00a0API</li>\n<li>we want the ability to include 3rd party resources and APIs in a simple\u00a0way</li>\n<li>we want to make the GraphQL API for the end user as simple as possible and hide complex Elasticsearch queries (e.g. the ones needed for full-text search, boosting and personalization) under the\u00a0hood</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Therefore, we decided to build our GraphQL API granularly, based on the needs of our API customers. By explicitly defining the GraphQL API and its schema we are keeping the flexibility to extend and\u00a0enhance.</p>\n<h3>Reusing GraphQL, Typescript and Elasticsearch Schema</h3>\n<p>One key benefit of GraphQL is the well defined schema which makes it easy to consume the API. But this schema must be explicitly defined.</p>\n<p>From the data import into Elasticsearch up to the GraphQL endpoint, the data schema is mostly redundant. To minimize error prone copy pasting and code duplication, we used <a href=\"https://www.prisma.io/blog/the-problems-of-schema-first-graphql-development-x1mn4cb0tyl3\">the Code First approach</a> and share the schema. Write once\u200a\u2014\u200ause everywhere.</p>\n<p>Therefore we defined our data schema by using Typescript models. These declarative models are then converted to Elasticsearch and GraphQL schema as needed. We open sourced part of this approach as <a href=\"https://github.com/smartive/es-model\">@smartive/es-model</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@smartive/es-model\">@smartive/es-model</a></p>\n<h3>Uncover Performance Issues with Loadtests</h3>\n<p>For meaningful results, we gathered the most frequent queries of our frontends and tested them against the GraphQL API at scale. We used <a href=\"https://jmeter.apache.org/\">jMeter</a> to set up the load tests and <a href=\"https://www.flood.io/\">flood.io</a> to parallelize the load onto different machines.</p>\n<p>This uncovered performance issues and bottlenecks. That is why we implemented caching for expensive 3rd party requests. We also identified issues with our relational dataset and the way GraphQL works. By denormalizing our datasource we could resolve this issue and even improve the overall performance.</p>\n<blockquote>At the end we have a GraphQL API running on two NodeJS nodes and two Elasticsearch nodes, <strong>serving up to 5000rpm in \u00f8\u00a050ms</strong>.</blockquote>\n<h3>Denormalizing Datasource for Improved Performance</h3>\n<p>Since we have much more reads than writes to our datasource we could drastically increase the performance by denormalizing our relational datasource in Elasticsearch.</p>\n<p>Imagine you want to retrieve the top 10 recipes with their ingredients which match your search term \u201cpie\u201d from the GraphQL\u00a0API.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/461/1*hl5EbYmyxHHCXdPdHz6Xqw.png\"></figure><p>If the ingredient details like name and image are stored in a separate index/table, then\u200a\u2014\u200aper default\u200a\u2014\u200athe GraphQL API will make one additional Elasticsearch Query for every ingredient of every recipe in the result\u00a0set.</p>\n<p>So for one GraphQL API call you would\u00a0have:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1 Elasticsearch query which retrieves 10\u00a0recipes</li>\n<li>5 Elasticsearch queries per recipe to retrieve the recipe\u2019s ingredient details (if a recipe has \u00f8 5 ingredients)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This makes a total of <strong>51 Elasticsearch queries per GraphQL\u00a0query</strong>!</p>\n<p>We could optimize this <a href=\"https://blog.smartive.ch/advanced-graphql-patterns-embrace-the-ast-4929647c5bd3\">by parsing the AST context of the GraphQL Query</a> to bring it down to one Elasticsearch query for all ingredients of the 10 recipes. But this is still too much. If we want to retrieve our result set with one single Elasticsearch query per GraphQL query we need to denormalize our datasource.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*f6lCaeOG99suka21ZUpCzw.png\"><figcaption>Datamodel of a Recipe with Ingredients: Normalized and denormalized</figcaption></figure><p>By denormalizing, we include the ingredients detail in every recipe dataset. This way the GraphQL API only needs one single Elasticsearch Query to get all the requested data.</p>\n<p>This approach of course only makes sense if you have a high read/write ratio and your datasource changes infrequently. But if that\u2019s the case, then denormalization can drastically improve performance.</p>\n<h3>Caching Expensive Requests with\u00a0Redis</h3>\n<p>Caching GraphQL APIs is much more complex than caching REST endpoints. So to keep things simple, we only applied caching for resources which are not under our control as for example 3rd party\u00a0APIs.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*tTkojwYiLDLr-F1srfF2QA.png\"><figcaption>Redis as an intermediate Cache for expensive Requests</figcaption></figure><p>For expensive 3rd Party REST API calls which are not under our control, we\u2019ve chosen to cache data in <a href=\"https://redis.io/\">Redis</a>. The cache is invalidated when data is updated or\u00a0stale.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>GraphQL provides a great framework for organizing and combining your APIs. But it also introduces a lot of complexity when dealing with relational data. Elasticsearch offers professional full-text search and high performance data retrieval. Together they build a world class team. But be aware of your use cases and restrict the APIs to make sure to deliver the best performance.</p>\n<h3>Build Enterprise-Grade GraphQL Applications</h3>\n<p>Want to become a GraphQL pro?

If you are looking for learning material on XState </em><a href=\"https://medium.com/u/3b9ee2f9eaa2\"><em>David Khourshid</em></a><em> has put together an </em><a href=\"https://xstate.js.org/docs/about/resources.html\"><em>up to date list of resources</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n<p>At <a href=\"https://smartive.ch/\">smartive</a> we always strive to improve our tech stack. That\u2019s why after my colleague <a href=\"https://medium.com/u/c10858e435f0\">Robert Vogt</a> told me about XState and its advantages in early 2019 I almost instantly fell in love with it. XState makes app logic easier to understand by declaratively describing what should happen when events occur and which explicit state the app has afterwards. <strong>We quickly realised that with XState in place we can build higher quality apps which are easier to extend, better to maintain and in the end more scalable. </strong>Since 2019 we have been developing apps for our clients using XState and never turned back to something else. Two examples are <a href=\"https://bosw.smartive.cloud/subsidia\">subsidia\u2019s payment and stock management app</a> and the <a href=\"https://bosw.smartive.cloud/migros-supply-chain/\">Supply Chain App</a> we developed for Migros (case studies below in\u00a0German).</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://bosw.smartive.cloud/subsidia\">Subsidia: Digitalisierung der Lifestyle-Branche.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://bosw.smartive.cloud/migros-supply-chain/\">Migros Supply Chain: Digitalisierung der Lieferkette.</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>After <a href=\"https://medium.com/u/3b9ee2f9eaa2\">David Khourshid</a> released his package <a href=\"https://xstate.js.org/docs/packages/xstate-test/\">@xstate/test</a> enabling a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-based_testing\">model based</a> testing approach we experimented with it on side projects to simplify our testing. @xstate/test takes an already defined state machine and tests along the paths of it, which will (mostly) cover all your use cases and therefore helps you to improve your tests and shortens the time to implement them.</p>\n<p>Naturally we wanted to use @xstate/test in the wild and in summer 2020, one of our clients and early adopter of XState subsidia wanted us to test parts of their newly built back office app with @xstate/test. <strong>Over time their apps have grown quite a lot and it is possible that with a conventional frontend testing approach they potentially miss a case. Or if they want to test all possible cases it is very time-consuming to write all the tests by hand.</strong> That\u2019s why they wanted us to integrate @xstate/test in order to make their lives\u00a0easier.</p>\n<h3>The Test\u00a0Case</h3>\n<p>Let us assume we needed to build an app to search for people. It should cover the following functionality:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Initially list 10\u00a0people</li>\n<li>If possible load additional 10 people (Pagination)</li>\n<li>Search for specific person (with a debounce to reduce useless API requests)</li>\n<li>Show an error if there was a network\u00a0problem</li>\n<li>Show a notification if there are no\u00a0results</li>\n<li>Show button to jump to top if no additional people can be\u00a0loaded</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From the given requirements we derived the following state\u00a0machine:</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/857/1*6nllAHcW-_aSiGwgPzEcXw.png\"><figcaption><a href=\"https://xstate.js.org/viz/?gist=e448c0770f1f00f69cbef7c0b5e03e02\">Visualised state chart</a> of the people search\u00a0app.</figcaption></figure><p>And with this state machine in place we built the following people search\u00a0app:</p>\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/media/a6a35cdeadb0f9259445d12cc52a10b6/href\">https://medium.com/media/a6a35cdeadb0f9259445d12cc52a10b6/href</a><p>With our test app running, let\u2019s get started with @xstate/test.</p>\n<h3>The Beginning</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://xstate.js.org/docs/packages/xstate-test/#quick-start\">@xstate/test Quick Start</a> states that there is the <a href=\"https://xstate.js.org/docs/packages/xstate-test/#createmodel-machine-options\">createModel</a>-function which takes any state machine and generates test path plans for it. The created model exposes two functions to generate these plans which can be used to test out your app\u2019s state machine. On one hand there is <a href=\"https://xstate.js.org/docs/packages/xstate-test/#testmodel-getsimplepathplans-options\">getSimplePathPlans</a> which will return all simple paths. Simple paths are paths from an initial state to any other state by traversing via any possible other state. On the other hand there is <a href=\"https://xstate.js.org/docs/packages/xstate-test/#testmodel-getshortestpathplans-options\">getShortestPathPlans</a> which returns the shortest paths from the initial state to any other\u00a0state.</p>\n<p>For the given case we decided to go with getSimplePathPlans since we like to test every possible state traversal combination. And that's where we encounter our first problem: the\u00a0guards.</p>\n<h3>The guards-Problem</h3>\n<p>When using createModel the state machine is executed in the test framework context without invoking any actual services. This leads to a problem, since the services most likely fetch data, which will alter the context and then determines the outcome of a guard. So calling getSimplePathPlans either fails at a specific guard, because no real data is available or the guard returns its default value, which leads to not all paths being generated and in turn not all available paths get\u00a0tested.</p>\n<p><strong>That's why we implemented a guard combination calculator function which takes a guards object and returns an array with all possible combinations of the guards.</strong> It actually builds a simple binary table (or a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_table#Logical_disjunction_(OR)\">logical </a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_table#Logical_disjunction_(OR)\">or truth table</a>) where each 0 or 1 is a possible result for a given guard function. To make this more comprehensible, let\u2019s take the guards from the people search\u00a0app:</p>\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/media/5e16ed5a539cf0a21968de2734cfe901/href\">https://medium.com/media/5e16ed5a539cf0a21968de2734cfe901/href</a><p>Each of the above guard-functions can either return false or true (0 or 1) and therefore lead to a different path within the state chart. But if there is no data since no actual service gets called during the evaluation of the state machine, it is not possible that for instance query or event.data will ever be defined. That's why we implemented a function which takes the guards object and builds an array with all possible combinations:</p>\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/media/9aa586d391ac0bc0a416517da975fe13/href\">https://medium.com/media/9aa586d391ac0bc0a416517da975fe13/href</a><p>Now we can iterate over the array and generate path plans to test for each combination by passing the generated guards into the machine as\u00a0configs.</p>\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/media/81f55d96053897f66039f0c138ddf19d/href\">https://medium.com/media/81f55d96053897f66039f0c138ddf19d/href</a><p>Finally we have all our path plans. But how does @xstate/test actually tests\u00a0them?</p>\n<h3>The meta-Problem</h3>\n<p>From the <a href=\"https://xstate.js.org/docs/packages/xstate-test/#quick-start\">@xstate/test Quick Start</a> we know that we need to add a meta-property to each state we like to test. So the people search state chart would look\u00a0like:</p>\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/media/543949fce865de06bd9f62b7b05066ae/href\">https://medium.com/media/543949fce865de06bd9f62b7b05066ae/href</a><p>But we do not like to have test code in our state charts as it will be delivered to the client\u2019s browser. Therefore we would like to extract the meta-code and programmatically append it to the given state chart, so that the test code can be written separately:</p>\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/media/20570e1b6e5e3512c5fa7d546eb3ac77/href\">https://medium.com/media/20570e1b6e5e3512c5fa7d546eb3ac77/href</a><p><a href=\"https://timdeschryver.dev/\">Tim Deschryver</a> wrote a very nice <a href=\"https://timdeschryver.dev/blog/generated-tests-with-xstate-and-cypress\">article</a> how he did this in combination with Cypress. We took his approach as a basis, added the above guard combination logic and a logging mechanism and released it as a package called <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@smartive/xstate-test-toolbox\">@smartive/xstate-test-toolbox</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@smartive/xstate-test-toolbox\">@smartive/xstate-test-toolbox</a></p>\n<p>The createTestPlans function from the package helped us to generate all possible test paths for our state machines:</p>\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/media/e7b1474b3b03605a1837c02492d93fa0/href\">https://medium.com/media/e7b1474b3b03605a1837c02492d93fa0/href</a><p>So now we have generated all tests from our state charts and magically everything gets tested\u200a\u2014\u200aWell, not quite. Since @xstate/test expects us to define what kind of user event or other event does execute a state change, we ran into the next\u00a0problem.</p>\n<h3>The async-Problem</h3>\n<p>The idea behind @xstate/test is that we define what should be tested in state X and what kind of action (e.g. a button click) transitions the app into the next state Y. So how do we test invoked services?</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s consider the following state chart as an\u00a0example:</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/648/1*Wf3UTgsuygMzE2seQsAVXA.png\"><figcaption>XState fetch example state\u00a0machine</figcaption></figure><p>With the following test\u00a0code:</p>\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/media/d1b657926b007a317f33cc3a7d184385/href\">https://medium.com/media/d1b657926b007a317f33cc3a7d184385/href</a><p>In our initial state idle we test the user interface to show some kind of idle element. To transition from idle to loading we tell @xtate/test to click the element with the selector [data-test=\"fetch\"] to trigger the FETCH event within the app. As we would expect, the loading state invokes the fetch service and would directly transition into success. But that leads to two problems:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>How can we test the loading state deterministically?</li>\n<li>What kind of action (e.g. click, type, etc.) do we have to define within our test event done.invoke.fetch to get the user interface and the underlying state machine from loading to\u00a0success?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The above example is a common use case within apps built with XState. To solve this problem when using TestCafe, we released another package called <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@smartive/testcafe-utils\">@smartive/testcafe-utils</a> which contains util classes and functions.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@smartive/testcafe-utils\">@smartive/testcafe-utils</a></p>\n<p>The package contains an interceptor class for XHR-calls, among other functions and classes, which can be initialised like:</p>\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/media/e58a9567a3c95439719d3d6ae221ab5c/href\">https://medium.com/media/e58a9567a3c95439719d3d6ae221ab5c/href</a><p>It then can be injected before our app loads with the help of TestCafe\u2019s clientScripts like test.clientScripts([xhrInterceptor.clientScript()]). Now every call to\u00a0.../fetch gets intercepted and kept unresolved until xhrInterceptor.resolve is called. This empowers us to define actions for invoke events like the one above. Now we can\u00a0write:</p>\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/media/69751ccdb6db6005353c5b06662b5a93/href\">https://medium.com/media/69751ccdb6db6005353c5b06662b5a93/href</a><h3>The Result</h3>\n<p>The whole code of the app above can be viewed <a href=\"https://github.com/dwirz/xstate-test-testcafe-swapi-example\">on GitHub</a>. It also has a <a href=\"https://github.com/dwirz/xstate-test-testcafe-swapi-example/blob/main/.github/workflows/test.yml\">workflow</a> in place which <a href=\"https://github.com/dwirz/xstate-test-testcafe-swapi-example/runs/1640050547?check_suite_focus=true\">successfully runs</a> the generated tests.

If you are looking for learning material on XState </em><a href=\"https://medium.com/u/3b9ee2f9eaa2\"><em>David Khourshid</em></a><em> has put together an </em><a href=\"https://xstate.js.org/docs/about/resources.html\"><em>up to date list of resources</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n<p>At <a href=\"https://smartive.ch/\">smartive</a> we always strive to improve our tech stack. That\u2019s why after my colleague <a href=\"https://medium.com/u/c10858e435f0\">Robert Vogt</a> told me about XState and its advantages in early 2019 I almost instantly fell in love with it. XState makes app logic easier to understand by declaratively describing what should happen when events occur and which explicit state the app has afterwards. <strong>We quickly realised that with XState in place we can build higher quality apps which are easier to extend, better to maintain and in the end more scalable. </strong>Since 2019 we have been developing apps for our clients using XState and never turned back to something else. Two examples are <a href=\"https://bosw.smartive.cloud/subsidia\">subsidia\u2019s payment and stock management app</a> and the <a href=\"https://bosw.smartive.cloud/migros-supply-chain/\">Supply Chain App</a> we developed for Migros (case studies below in\u00a0German).</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://bosw.smartive.cloud/subsidia\">Subsidia: Digitalisierung der Lifestyle-Branche.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://bosw.smartive.cloud/migros-supply-chain/\">Migros Supply Chain: Digitalisierung der Lieferkette.</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>After <a href=\"https://medium.com/u/3b9ee2f9eaa2\">David Khourshid</a> released his package <a href=\"https://xstate.js.org/docs/packages/xstate-test/\">@xstate/test</a> enabling a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-based_testing\">model based</a> testing approach we experimented with it on side projects to simplify our testing. @xstate/test takes an already defined state machine and tests along the paths of it, which will (mostly) cover all your use cases and therefore helps you to improve your tests and shortens the time to implement them.</p>\n<p>Naturally we wanted to use @xstate/test in the wild and in summer 2020, one of our clients and early adopter of XState subsidia wanted us to test parts of their newly built back office app with @xstate/test. <strong>Over time their apps have grown quite a lot and it is possible that with a conventional frontend testing approach they potentially miss a case. Or if they want to test all possible cases it is very time-consuming to write all the tests by hand.</strong> That\u2019s why they wanted us to integrate @xstate/test in order to make their lives\u00a0easier.</p>\n<h3>The Test\u00a0Case</h3>\n<p>Let us assume we needed to build an app to search for people. It should cover the following functionality:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Initially list 10\u00a0people</li>\n<li>If possible load additional 10 people (Pagination)</li>\n<li>Search for specific person (with a debounce to reduce useless API requests)</li>\n<li>Show an error if there was a network\u00a0problem</li>\n<li>Show a notification if there are no\u00a0results</li>\n<li>Show button to jump to top if no additional people can be\u00a0loaded</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From the given requirements we derived the following state\u00a0machine:</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/857/1*6nllAHcW-_aSiGwgPzEcXw.png\"><figcaption><a href=\"https://xstate.js.org/viz/?gist=e448c0770f1f00f69cbef7c0b5e03e02\">Visualised state chart</a> of the people search\u00a0app.</figcaption></figure><p>And with this state machine in place we built the following people search\u00a0app:</p>\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/media/a6a35cdeadb0f9259445d12cc52a10b6/href\">https://medium.com/media/a6a35cdeadb0f9259445d12cc52a10b6/href</a><p>With our test app running, let\u2019s get started with @xstate/test.</p>\n<h3>The Beginning</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://xstate.js.org/docs/packages/xstate-test/#quick-start\">@xstate/test Quick Start</a> states that there is the <a href=\"https://xstate.js.org/docs/packages/xstate-test/#createmodel-machine-options\">createModel</a>-function which takes any state machine and generates test path plans for it. The created model exposes two functions to generate these plans which can be used to test out your app\u2019s state machine. On one hand there is <a href=\"https://xstate.js.org/docs/packages/xstate-test/#testmodel-getsimplepathplans-options\">getSimplePathPlans</a> which will return all simple paths. Simple paths are paths from an initial state to any other state by traversing via any possible other state. On the other hand there is <a href=\"https://xstate.js.org/docs/packages/xstate-test/#testmodel-getshortestpathplans-options\">getShortestPathPlans</a> which returns the shortest paths from the initial state to any other\u00a0state.</p>\n<p>For the given case we decided to go with getSimplePathPlans since we like to test every possible state traversal combination. And that's where we encounter our first problem: the\u00a0guards.</p>\n<h3>The guards-Problem</h3>\n<p>When using createModel the state machine is executed in the test framework context without invoking any actual services. This leads to a problem, since the services most likely fetch data, which will alter the context and then determines the outcome of a guard. So calling getSimplePathPlans either fails at a specific guard, because no real data is available or the guard returns its default value, which leads to not all paths being generated and in turn not all available paths get\u00a0tested.</p>\n<p><strong>That's why we implemented a guard combination calculator function which takes a guards object and returns an array with all possible combinations of the guards.</strong> It actually builds a simple binary table (or a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_table#Logical_disjunction_(OR)\">logical </a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_table#Logical_disjunction_(OR)\">or truth table</a>) where each 0 or 1 is a possible result for a given guard function. To make this more comprehensible, let\u2019s take the guards from the people search\u00a0app:</p>\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/media/5e16ed5a539cf0a21968de2734cfe901/href\">https://medium.com/media/5e16ed5a539cf0a21968de2734cfe901/href</a><p>Each of the above guard-functions can either return false or true (0 or 1) and therefore lead to a different path within the state chart. But if there is no data since no actual service gets called during the evaluation of the state machine, it is not possible that for instance query or event.data will ever be defined. That's why we implemented a function which takes the guards object and builds an array with all possible combinations:</p>\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/media/9aa586d391ac0bc0a416517da975fe13/href\">https://medium.com/media/9aa586d391ac0bc0a416517da975fe13/href</a><p>Now we can iterate over the array and generate path plans to test for each combination by passing the generated guards into the machine as\u00a0configs.</p>\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/media/81f55d96053897f66039f0c138ddf19d/href\">https://medium.com/media/81f55d96053897f66039f0c138ddf19d/href</a><p>Finally we have all our path plans. But how does @xstate/test actually tests\u00a0them?</p>\n<h3>The meta-Problem</h3>\n<p>From the <a href=\"https://xstate.js.org/docs/packages/xstate-test/#quick-start\">@xstate/test Quick Start</a> we know that we need to add a meta-property to each state we like to test. So the people search state chart would look\u00a0like:</p>\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/media/543949fce865de06bd9f62b7b05066ae/href\">https://medium.com/media/543949fce865de06bd9f62b7b05066ae/href</a><p>But we do not like to have test code in our state charts as it will be delivered to the client\u2019s browser. Therefore we would like to extract the meta-code and programmatically append it to the given state chart, so that the test code can be written separately:</p>\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/media/20570e1b6e5e3512c5fa7d546eb3ac77/href\">https://medium.com/media/20570e1b6e5e3512c5fa7d546eb3ac77/href</a><p><a href=\"https://timdeschryver.dev/\">Tim Deschryver</a> wrote a very nice <a href=\"https://timdeschryver.dev/blog/generated-tests-with-xstate-and-cypress\">article</a> how he did this in combination with Cypress. We took his approach as a basis, added the above guard combination logic and a logging mechanism and released it as a package called <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@smartive/xstate-test-toolbox\">@smartive/xstate-test-toolbox</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@smartive/xstate-test-toolbox\">@smartive/xstate-test-toolbox</a></p>\n<p>The createTestPlans function from the package helped us to generate all possible test paths for our state machines:</p>\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/media/e7b1474b3b03605a1837c02492d93fa0/href\">https://medium.com/media/e7b1474b3b03605a1837c02492d93fa0/href</a><p>So now we have generated all tests from our state charts and magically everything gets tested\u200a\u2014\u200aWell, not quite. Since @xstate/test expects us to define what kind of user event or other event does execute a state change, we ran into the next\u00a0problem.</p>\n<h3>The async-Problem</h3>\n<p>The idea behind @xstate/test is that we define what should be tested in state X and what kind of action (e.g. a button click) transitions the app into the next state Y. So how do we test invoked services?</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s consider the following state chart as an\u00a0example:</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/648/1*Wf3UTgsuygMzE2seQsAVXA.png\"><figcaption>XState fetch example state\u00a0machine</figcaption></figure><p>With the following test\u00a0code:</p>\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/media/d1b657926b007a317f33cc3a7d184385/href\">https://medium.com/media/d1b657926b007a317f33cc3a7d184385/href</a><p>In our initial state idle we test the user interface to show some kind of idle element. To transition from idle to loading we tell @xtate/test to click the element with the selector [data-test=\"fetch\"] to trigger the FETCH event within the app. As we would expect, the loading state invokes the fetch service and would directly transition into success. But that leads to two problems:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>How can we test the loading state deterministically?</li>\n<li>What kind of action (e.g. click, type, etc.) do we have to define within our test event done.invoke.fetch to get the user interface and the underlying state machine from loading to\u00a0success?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The above example is a common use case within apps built with XState. To solve this problem when using TestCafe, we released another package called <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@smartive/testcafe-utils\">@smartive/testcafe-utils</a> which contains util classes and functions.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@smartive/testcafe-utils\">@smartive/testcafe-utils</a></p>\n<p>The package contains an interceptor class for XHR-calls, among other functions and classes, which can be initialised like:</p>\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/media/e58a9567a3c95439719d3d6ae221ab5c/href\">https://medium.com/media/e58a9567a3c95439719d3d6ae221ab5c/href</a><p>It then can be injected before our app loads with the help of TestCafe\u2019s clientScripts like test.clientScripts([xhrInterceptor.clientScript()]). Now every call to\u00a0.../fetch gets intercepted and kept unresolved until xhrInterceptor.resolve is called. This empowers us to define actions for invoke events like the one above. Now we can\u00a0write:</p>\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/media/69751ccdb6db6005353c5b06662b5a93/href\">https://medium.com/media/69751ccdb6db6005353c5b06662b5a93/href</a><h3>The Result</h3>\n<p>The whole code of the app above can be viewed <a href=\"https://github.com/dwirz/xstate-test-testcafe-swapi-example\">on GitHub</a>. It also has a <a href=\"https://github.com/dwirz/xstate-test-testcafe-swapi-example/blob/main/.github/workflows/test.yml\">workflow</a> in place which <a href=\"https://github.com/dwirz/xstate-test-testcafe-swapi-example/runs/1640050547?check_suite_focus=true\">successfully runs</a> the generated tests.

    "description": "\n<h3>New Work &amp; Innovation\u200a\u2014\u200aOne-on-One with your\u00a0Buddy</h3>\n<p>We at <a href=\"https://smartive.ch/\">smartive</a> strive to improve ourselves as well as our work processes. The concept of <em>New Work</em> offers a holistic approach in running a company and is in line with our principles.</p>\n<p>Since we do not have any hierarchy nor any formal managers, we use four different tools to steer the\u00a0company:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We incorporated the <a href=\"https://blog.smartive.ch/new-work-innovation-the-advice-process-1ba8a12e6e73\"><strong>advice process</strong></a> to enable everybody in our company to make any decision.</li>\n<li>With a <strong>quarterly held company retrospective</strong> we constantly improve our processes.</li>\n<li>To keep everybody up to date we hold a <strong>monthly all-hands meeting</strong>. It is always facilitated by another colleague to foster ownership and keep the meeting interesting and\u00a0fun.</li>\n<li>In our <strong>weekly pulse check </strong>everybody fills in a form with 4 questions to be\u00a0rated:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>How do you like the project you\u2019re currently working\u00a0on?</li>\n<li>How satisfied are you with your performance?</li>\n<li>What is your workload?</li>\n<li>What is your satisfaction in general at\u00a0work?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additionally you can leave a comment to give some\u00a0context.</p>\n<p>Since the answers are internally accessible to everyone, over time you get a pretty good understanding on the wellbeing of the individuals and the company as a whole. Based on the data of this weekly pulse check anybody can work out improvements following the <a href=\"https://blog.smartive.ch/new-work-innovation-the-advice-process-1ba8a12e6e73\">advice\u00a0process</a>.</p>\n<p>With these four tools we handle company-wide challenges. But some challenges do not affect the whole\u00a0company.</p>\n<p>How do we deal with\u00a0these?</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*fLFLX_rmXJNKXx72uUj4CQ.jpeg\"><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@serge_photography?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Serge van Neck</a> on\u00a0<a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/two-trees?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><h3>One-on-Ones with your\u00a0Buddy</h3>\n<p>To pay attention to more personal matters we introduced the one-on-one meeting with a\u00a0buddy.</p>\n<h4>Why we introduced the Buddy-System</h4>\n<p>We improve our skills, take on more responsibilities (or change our hair cut \ud83d\udc87\u200d\u2640\ufe0f). Motivation varies, depending on the project we\u2019re working on. New people join and team dynamics change. You get it: Everything underlies constant\u00a0changes.</p>\n<p>We need to deal with these changes whether we like or not. But the good news is, we can influence the outcome of these changes in a positive\u00a0way.</p>\n<h4><strong>How does our One-on-One System\u00a0work</strong></h4>\n<p>Everyone in the company chooses another colleague as their buddy. The two co-workers define the length and the setting of the meeting. It might be a formal meeting, a shared lunch or a beer in the evening. Also the content and the goal of the meeting are up to the\u00a0buddies.</p>\n<p>However, there are three\u00a0rules:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The meeting takes place at least once a\u00a0month.</li>\n<li>Define one or more action steps and write them\u00a0down.</li>\n<li>The topics discussed are confidential.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong>Our Experiences so\u00a0far</strong></h4>\n<p>We introduced the one-on-one meetings eight months ago and we are pretty happy with the result.

The concept of <em>New Work</em> offers a holistic approach in running a company and is in line with our principles.</p>\n<p>Since we do not have any hierarchy nor any formal managers, we use four different tools to steer the\u00a0company:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We incorporated the <a href=\"https://blog.smartive.ch/new-work-innovation-the-advice-process-1ba8a12e6e73\"><strong>advice process</strong></a> to enable everybody in our company to make any decision.</li>\n<li>With a <strong>quarterly held company retrospective</strong> we constantly improve our processes.</li>\n<li>To keep everybody up to date we hold a <strong>monthly all-hands meeting</strong>. It is always facilitated by another colleague to foster ownership and keep the meeting interesting and\u00a0fun.</li>\n<li>In our <strong>weekly pulse check </strong>everybody fills in a form with 4 questions to be\u00a0rated:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>How do you like the project you\u2019re currently working\u00a0on?</li>\n<li>How satisfied are you with your performance?</li>\n<li>What is your workload?</li>\n<li>What is your satisfaction in general at\u00a0work?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additionally you can leave a comment to give some\u00a0context.</p>\n<p>Since the answers are internally accessible to everyone, over time you get a pretty good understanding on the wellbeing of the individuals and the company as a whole. Based on the data of this weekly pulse check anybody can work out improvements following the <a href=\"https://blog.smartive.ch/new-work-innovation-the-advice-process-1ba8a12e6e73\">advice\u00a0process</a>.</p>\n<p>With these four tools we handle company-wide challenges. But some challenges do not affect the whole\u00a0company.</p>\n<p>How do we deal with\u00a0these?</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*fLFLX_rmXJNKXx72uUj4CQ.jpeg\"><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@serge_photography?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Serge van Neck</a> on\u00a0<a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/two-trees?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><h3>One-on-Ones with your\u00a0Buddy</h3>\n<p>To pay attention to more personal matters we introduced the one-on-one meeting with a\u00a0buddy.</p>\n<h4>Why we introduced the Buddy-System</h4>\n<p>We improve our skills, take on more responsibilities (or change our hair cut \ud83d\udc87\u200d\u2640\ufe0f). Motivation varies, depending on the project we\u2019re working on. New people join and team dynamics change. You get it: Everything underlies constant\u00a0changes.</p>\n<p>We need to deal with these changes whether we like or not. But the good news is, we can influence the outcome of these changes in a positive\u00a0way.</p>\n<h4><strong>How does our One-on-One System\u00a0work</strong></h4>\n<p>Everyone in the company chooses another colleague as their buddy. The two co-workers define the length and the setting of the meeting. It might be a formal meeting, a shared lunch or a beer in the evening. Also the content and the goal of the meeting are up to the\u00a0buddies.</p>\n<p>However, there are three\u00a0rules:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The meeting takes place at least once a\u00a0month.</li>\n<li>Define one or more action steps and write them\u00a0down.</li>\n<li>The topics discussed are confidential.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong>Our Experiences so\u00a0far</strong></h4>\n<p>We introduced the one-on-one meetings eight months ago and we are pretty happy with the result. Nevertheless, there are three lessons we\u2019d like to\u00a0share:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It\u2019s important to have an overall goal for the one-on-one meeting.</li>\n<li>Writing down actions steps is necessary to keep the long-term goals in\u00a0mind.</li>\n<li>A buddy is neither a coach nor a problem-solver. A buddy is more like a friend. A friend\u2019s eye is a good mirror: She or he challenges you and discusses options to deal with the changes affecting you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>How do you foster innovation and guidance at your company?

But the apparent peace was to be abruptly disturbed.</p>\n<p>A month into my internship, the distant rumours about COVID-19 suddenly became a harsh reality when Switzerland confirmed the first case at the end of February 2020. Shortly after, we were banished to our home offices indefinitely.</p>\n<p>Although no one could have possibly prepared for such a scenario, I was positively surprised by the way the team dealt with the crisis. Without further ado, face-to-face interactions now took place screen-to-screen via Google Meet and Slack. Pair programming sessions were held using <a href=\"https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/live-share/\">Visual Studio Live Share</a>, a real-time collaboration tool for VSCode. Team events were skillfully adapted to fit our home office environments and weekly remote coffee breaks boosted team morale when there seemed no silver\u00a0lining.</p>\n<blockquote>\u201cOnly in the need to prove it do we realise how much strength lies within\u00a0us.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p>Even if the circumstances were less than ideal, I\u2019m positive that the crisis not only gave rise to toilet paper panic buying and a booming market for self-made face masks. It also brought forth people\u2019s readiness to help others, their capacity for innovation in the face of change and a renewed appreciation of social interactions and community.</p>\n<p><strong>A story yet to be\u00a0told</strong></p>\n<p>Looking back on the past six months I feel a kind of detachment. But at the same time I have never felt as connected. From high up above, revolving slowly and steadily in my newfound orbit, this beautiful world beneath me seems too good to be true.

Shortly after, we were banished to our home offices indefinitely.</p>\n<p>Although no one could have possibly prepared for such a scenario, I was positively surprised by the way the team dealt with the crisis. Without further ado, face-to-face interactions now took place screen-to-screen via Google Meet and Slack. Pair programming sessions were held using <a href=\"https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/live-share/\">Visual Studio Live Share</a>, a real-time collaboration tool for VSCode. Team events were skillfully adapted to fit our home office environments and weekly remote coffee breaks boosted team morale when there seemed no silver\u00a0lining.</p>\n<blockquote>\u201cOnly in the need to prove it do we realise how much strength lies within\u00a0us.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p>Even if the circumstances were less than ideal, I\u2019m positive that the crisis not only gave rise to toilet paper panic buying and a booming market for self-made face masks. It also brought forth people\u2019s readiness to help others, their capacity for innovation in the face of change and a renewed appreciation of social interactions and community.</p>\n<p><strong>A story yet to be\u00a0told</strong></p>\n<p>Looking back on the past six months I feel a kind of detachment. But at the same time I have never felt as connected. From high up above, revolving slowly and steadily in my newfound orbit, this beautiful world beneath me seems too good to be true. I feel extraordinarily lucky to have been welcomed into the World of Web Development at smartive, to have the opportunity to learn alongside such a dedicated team and to contribute all I can to help it thrive\u200a\u2014\u200acome what\u00a0may.</p>\n<blockquote><em>\u201cWe seem to live in a history book that has yet to be written.

So how do we make decisions? We truly believe that no one can make better decisions than the people involved in the problems\u00a0itself.</p>\n<p>So we don\u2019t want to have any managers to make decisions for us but neither do we want to have to ask anyone in the company to make democratic decisions.

But before doing so, that person must seek advice from all affected parties and people with expertise on the\u00a0matter.</blockquote>\n<p>So everyone who is affected by a problem or an opportunity will have the possibility to initiate a change.
